# DataThrone

This is the notebook I prepared for the DataThrone challenge organized by the AUST Innovation and Design Club. The goal of this challenge was to analyze, visualize and find treasures from the dataset. The data of a social media platform of an organization is analyzed and visualized in this notebook.
